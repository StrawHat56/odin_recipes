            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 ounces almond biscotti </li>
            <li>11/2 cups brewed espresso, cooled </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua</li>
            <li>Ladyfingers for Tiramisu</li>
            <li>11/2 cups heavy cream </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Best-quality milk chocolate, chilled, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To prepare this delicious treat follow the instructions below:
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together yolks and mascarpone in a large bowl until smooth. Add granulated sugar; whisk until dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place biscotti in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to form coarse crumbs. Fold biscotti into mascarpone mixture; set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add egg whites; beat until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine espresso and liqueur in a medium bowl; pour half the mixture into a pie plate. Quickly dip half the ladyfingers individually into the pie plate, and place in the bottom of a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish; fit snugly to line. Evenly spread half the mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers; repeat layers.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form. Spread whipped cream evenly over tiramisu; garnish with grated chocolate. Chill at least 2 hours and preferably overnight before serving.</li>
